## Google Maps MacOS App
=========

### About
A personal MacOS application in Python that prompts the user for a destination and opens up Firefox to the <https://google.com/maps> location of the specified destination.

### Tools used

1. Python
2. Selenium
3. Geckodriver
4. Automator, the MacOS application

### Goals for this project

1. Automate my daily tasks of finding a location
2. Work with different web browser Python libraries
3. Try to make a personal application that can be clicked on and run a script

### Process

The idea for this project came to me when I was trying to find the closest Starbucks near me. I use <https://google.com/maps> pretty frequently and I thought it'd be a fun and challenging task to automate my searches. I thought it'd be pretty cool to click on an application and prompt me for a location and then automatically google search the location I entered. I felt like it would help speed up my daily google searches instead of having to open the web browser, go to <https://google.com/maps>, and then search.

### Lessons learned

1. How to install the geckodriver executable and add it to my PATH
2. How to use Selenium to automate browser actions.
3. Use previous HTML/CSS knowledge to target web page items for Selenium.
4. How to work with Selenium actions to send text into forms, click buttons, and load pages.
5. How to use Automator to create a .app file to prompt user for input, store the input, and send it as an argument into a Python script.

### Extensions for the future

1. Use Selenium to automate web application testing.
2. Use Selenium to automate browser tasks to purchase high-demand items that sell out quickly.
